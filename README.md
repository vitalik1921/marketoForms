# Marketo Forms
Plugin allows to add Marketo forms (http://www.marketo.com/) to the site using shortcodes and function. Also it adds
useful classes for form fields.

## Installation
1. Copy to 'plugins' folder
2. Activate
3. Go to Settings -> Marketo Forms and add subscriber ID

##Usage
Before using you should open Settings -> Marketo Forms and enter your base URL and Subscriber ID. This information you
can get from Marketo, or you can extract it from generated code in Marketo back-end. It looks like this:

MktoForms2.loadForm("base url", "subscriber  id", $form_id, callback_function);

After that you can use shortcode to display Marketo from:

[marketo id=10]

where id - is form identificator

Also developers can use function to display forms:

marketo_display_form($form_id);
